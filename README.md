# Project Status
### About:
This is an individual project, completed as Coursework for AQA Computer Science A Level, using full-stack development. It was completed using Microsoft Visual Studio Code and XAMPP (for Apache and MySQL).

### The Project Description:
Within this project, I created a database management web application for the school staff. This has the functionality to manage the whole project and is protected by a secure login system. This system is intended to be extensive and detailed, yet intuitive and user-friendly. I designed the database in Normal Form, and intentionally created the user-interface for a high level of abstraction since the database is very vast.

I also created a mobile application for updating whether sixth form students are in school or not. The app system is fully automated and signs the students in and out of their school. It stores the status of each student dependent on whether their chosen mobile device is on site. 

## Other:
Throughout the project, the Software Development Lifecycle is documented in the WriteUp.pdf file. This contains detailed descriptions of my Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Testing.

The project is built using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. It utilises Procedural Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Declarative Programming, and Markup.

I hope to update and improve my mobile application now that I have the knowledge of Java (or potentially Kotlin) required for this.
